runner_server:
-------------------------------------------------

o) run-alpine-test
   - 0C9 add permissions

o) if the file being copied is wibble.sh (say) and has
   execute rights then does [docker cp] preserve the
   execute status of wibble.sh inside the container?

o) storing test new_avatar is idempotent

o) massage micro_service returned strings.
   - clean them
   - truncate them

o) runner_server micro-service needs to check each shell call and return
   { status:error, output:msg }
   if something goes wrong.

o) add cpu/memory/swap limits
   See comments at https://github.com/cyber-dojo/commander/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
   See https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9437
   for suggestion that limits might be uid/gid based.
   Should I use cyber-dojo user and not nobody:nogroup ?
   What if the image does not have cyber-dojo user?
   I guess I can just use its integer id, 19661

   From [docker run --help]
   --blkio-weight value          Block IO (relative weight), between 10 and 1000
   --blkio-weight-device value   Block IO weight (relative device weight) (default []
   --cpu-period int              Limit CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period
   --cpu-quota int               Limit CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota
   -c, --cpu-shares int
   --device-read-bps value       Limit read rate (bytes per second) from a device (default [])
   --device-read-iops value      Limit read rate (IO per second) from a device (default [])
   --device-write-bps value      Limit write rate (bytes per second) to a device (default [])
   --device-write-iops value     Limit write rate (IO per second) to a device (default [])
   --isolation string            Container isolation technology
   --kernel-memory string        Kernel memory limit
   -m, --memory string               Memory limit
   --memory-reservation string   Memory soft limit
   --memory-swap string          Swap limit equal to memory plus swap: '-1' to enable unlimited swap
   --memory-swappiness int       Tune container memory swappiness (0 to 100) (default -1)
   --pids-limit int              Tune container pids limit (set -1 for unlimited)
   --ulimit value                Ulimit options (default [])

o) what if filename has a quote in it?

o) log assert_exec() fail in docker_runner.rb

-------------------------------------------------

o) can you copying a changed file into the container via a named-pipe?
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe
   - https://github.com/shurizzle/ruby-mkfifo

   File.mkfifo('/tmp/file')
   tar -zcf /tmp/file | docker exec ... sh -c 'tar -zxf - -C /sandbox'
   IO.write('/tmp/file', content)
   `rm /tmp/file`

o) write the hello()-datetime to a known file inside the volume.
   write the run()-datetime to a known file inside the volume.
   Separate reaper/pruner service can delete old volumes.
   Or should the time-stamps come from the storer?

o) validate microservice parameters?
   - kata_id = 10 hex chars
   - avatar_name = one of the known 64 animals
   - max_seconds = integer (with max of 15 seconds?)
   - deleted_filenames (what chars are illegal in linux filename?)
   - changed_files

o) Should there be a volume per kata rather than per animal?
   This feels right. Fits with the value-system of cyber-dojo.
   Keeps the number of volumes down too.
   Means hello()/goodbye() will only need kata_id.
   And could be renamed... new_kata(id), old_kata(id)
   Resuming an avatar will need to redo the new_kata(id)

o) Should I use a different uid for the run of each avatar
   and for the rights of their files?

-------------------------------------------------

o) [./cyber-dojo update]
   does not update the language images. Should it?
